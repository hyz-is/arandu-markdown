# Changelog

Everything worth knowing about a release of :package_name is recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A published module version is immutable: Go serves it from the proxy forever, so
a release is corrected by another release and never by moving a tag.

## [Unreleased]

<!-- configure:template-start -->
The entries below are the release history of the package skeleton this file
was cloned with. `configure` removes them, so a configured package starts with
an empty changelog rather than with somebody else's.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Record the release entry before tagging so the exact-archive publication gate can publish it. The immutable v0.6.1 tag was left unchanged after its missing-entry refusal.
- Pin Framework v0.47.1 and Hesape v0.41.1, including the native UI initialization correction.
- Run the existing checks on develop before promotion to main.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- The release history of this repository sits inside a `configure:template`
  section, so `configure` removes it and a configured package starts with an
  empty changelog rather than with this one's. It did not: the markers rename
  the template's values into the two files and nothing else, so two published
  packages shipped a changelog whose highest heading described a release of this
  repository, with everything they had actually added filed as unreleased.
- The release tests name no version of this repository. Two of them asserted
  that this repository's own notes were present, which a clone inherits and
  cannot satisfy -- so instead of catching the wrong content they held it in
  place. What is left is generic: an action declared in `policy.go` and a
  migration declared in `module.go` have to be named under a version heading
  rather than under `[Unreleased]`, the two release files have to describe the
  same set of versions, and no version may be headed twice. A package that has
  released nothing skips them.

### Added

- `TestTheReleaseHistoryBelongsToTheTemplateSection`, which refuses a release
  heading written outside the section `configure` removes.

### Fixed

- `## [0.3.1]` described what `v0.3.0` shipped, and `v0.3.0` had no entry at
  all. `v0.1.0` had none either, and `UPGRADE.md` had notes for neither those
  two nor `v0.3.1`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `(*Module).Publishes` declares one `foundation.Publication`, tagged as a view.
  The contract belongs to the framework, so whatever writes the files reads
  every module through one interface instead of one this package defined for
  itself.

### Changed

- The minimum Framework version is now `v0.46.0`, with Hesape `v0.25.0`.
- `(*Module).Publishes` returns `[]foundation.Publication` instead of `io/fs.FS`.
- `PublishCommand` is now `aru vendor:publish --apply`.
- `(*Module).Boot` names the package whose import links the views, alongside the
  view and the command.

### Removed

- `Publishable`, the contract this package declared for itself.
  `foundation.Publishable` is the one it answers now.
- `Publishes`, the package-level function. There was a second form because a
  command with no database handle could not hold a `Module`; there is no such
  command any more.
- `publish`, the command of this module. `aru vendor:publish` reads the modules
  an application registered and writes what each one declares, which is a
  question only the application can answer.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- The changelog entry the release gate reads sits under the heading that names
  its version. The gate takes a release's notes out of that heading, and an
  entry still under `[Unreleased]` has none to be found by.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `Publishable`, the optional contract a module answers to hand files to the
  application, and `Publishes()` on `Module`.
- `PublishedPaths`, `ViewNames` and `ViewPackages`, the three spellings of one
  view derived from the archive rather than written down separately.
- `PublishCommand`, the one spelling of the command that copies the views.
- `publish`, a command of this module: `go run <module>/publish@latest` writes
  the views under `resources/views/vendor/<module>/`, refuses to replace a file
  the project already has without `--force`, and prints the imports that link
  them.
- `(*Module).Boot` refuses to serve when a view this package renders was never
  published, naming the view and the command instead of answering the first
  request that reaches it with a 500.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- `Skeletons(db)` exposes the configured, tenant-scoped Model used by the
  Service after authorization.

### Changed

- The minimum Framework version is now `v0.41.0`, with Hesape `v0.19.1`.
- `NewSkeletonService` now accepts `*data.DB` instead of
  `*SkeletonRepository`.
- `(*SkeletonService).Create` now returns `(*Skeleton, error)`.
- `(*SkeletonService).Find` now returns `(*Skeleton, error)`.
- `(*SkeletonService).List` now returns `([]*Skeleton, error)`.
- `Skeleton`: old is comparable; new is not because it embeds
  `model.Model[Skeleton]`. Compare stable fields such as `ID` instead.

### Removed

- `SkeletonRepository` and `NewSkeletonRepository`.
- `(*SkeletonRepository).Create`, `(*SkeletonRepository).Delete`,
  `(*SkeletonRepository).Find`, `(*SkeletonRepository).List`, and
  `(*SkeletonRepository).Update`. Add a Repository only for specialized
  queries, reports, projections, read models, exports, or external storage.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- The skeleton somebody clones to write an Arandu package: `Skeleton`,
  `SkeletonService`, `SkeletonPolicy`, `Module`, `Config`, and
  `20260823_0001_create_skeletons` written with the Blueprint.
- `SkeletonPolicy`, and the actions it answers about: `SkeletonView`,
  `SkeletonList`, `SkeletonCreate`, `SkeletonUpdate` and `SkeletonDelete`.
- `configure.go`, which turns the template into a package of its own and then
  deletes itself.
- The structure gate: a package arrives knowing what it has to look like, so a
  clone that drifts from the contract fails its own suite rather than somebody
  else's review.
- A route prefix a package cannot register is rejected rather than accepted and
  left unreachable.
- The skill that explains the package, and the vault note it records itself in,
  both cloned with it.
